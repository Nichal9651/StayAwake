 What It Does

- Monitors eyes in real time using webcam 👁️
- Calculates Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) 🧮
- Triggers an audio alert if eyes are closed too long 🔊


🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV
- Dlib
- SciPy
- Pygame (for audio alerts)

Run Locally

## 👥 Team & Role

This was a group project built to detect driver drowsiness using computer vision and ML on Raspberry Pi.

**My Role (Nichal Haas):**
- Integrated face and eye detection using OpenCV and Haar cascades
- Implemented ML logic for drowsiness detection on real-time camera feed
- Calibrated detection parameters and optimized responsiveness on constrained Pi hardware
